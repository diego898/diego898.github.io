    "text": "1-D Network\nLets give the simplest network we can imagine. One that consists of a few 1-D “layers” of size 1! We have an: * input node/layer, * hidden node/layer:h_1, * another hidden node/layer h_2 * output node/layer.\nNetworks are typically drawn with the weights on the wires. Our simple network can be given as: \n\nNote: This is sometimes confusing, as technically its the activations of the previous layer that “flow” into the next layer. However, the weights are what we are tying to learn, and their relative strengths tells us something about the structure of the network.\n\nEach node has an associated: * weight * bias * activation function\nIn our example, we have w_1,b_1,w_2,b_2,w_3,b_3 as our parameters and we are using the sigmoid as our activation function.\nThe function of each node, is to apply its own weight and bias to a previous layers activation value, and then pass it through its activation function to produce its own activation. For example, h_1 is doing:\n\na_1 = \\sigma(w\\cdot x + b)\n\nThe input to a nodes activation function is useful to think about separately, so we can introduce an additional variable to denote it as: \nz_i = w\\cdot x + b, \\quad\\quad a_1 = \\sigma(z_i)\n\nSo, we can describe the behavior of each of our nodes as:\n\n\nImplementation\nNow we can actually implement this simple network. Lets start by recalling the sigmoid function:\n\ndef sigmoid(x):\n    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))\n\nplt.plot(np.linspace(-5,5),sigmoid(np.linspace(-5,5)));\n\n\n\n\nLets define the function of a node, being careful to match our notation:\n\ndef node(w,b,a):\n    z = w*a + b\n    return sigmoid(z)\n\nNow we are ready to define our actual network! Lets initialize our random weights and biases:\n\nw1,b1,w2,b2,w3,b3 = np.random.rand(6)\n\nNow, lets pick a training example and run it through our network:\n\ninput,label = inputs[0],labels[0]\n\n# h1 node - operates on our input\na1 = node(w1,b1,input)\n\n# h2 node - operates on a1\na2 = node(w2,b2,a1)\n\n# output node - operates on a2 - produces our output\noutput = node(w3,b3,a2)\ny_hat = output\n\nLets see how we did!\n\nprint(f\"for input: {input} with label: {label}, this network calculated: {y_hat}\")\n\nfor input: [-5.] with label: [-1], this network calculated: [0.74906357]\n\n\nAs we know, to actually see how we did, we need to define a cost! Lets proceed with the usual average-MSE:\n\ndef mse(y_hat,y,average=True):\n    if average:\n        return np.mean((y_hat-y)**2)\n    else:\n        return ((y_hat-y)**2)\n\n\ndef cost_mse(y_hat,y):\n    return 0.5*np.linalg.norm(y-y_hat)**2\n\n\nprint(f\"for input: {input} with label: {label}, this network calculated: {output}, giving us a cost of: {mse(output,label)}\")\n\nfor input: [-5.] with label: [-1], this network calculated: [0.74906357], giving us a cost of: 3.0592233770969504\n\n\nOk - so we’ve demonstrated the entire forward direction, for one sample. Lets define a function for this simple network, so we can run our entire training set through!\n\ndef simple_network(inputs):\n    outputs = []\n    N = inputs.shape[0]\n    \n    # initialized weights\n    w1,b1,w2,b2,w3,b3 = np.random.rand(6)\n\n    for i in range(N):\n        input = inputs[i,:]\n        \n        # h1 node\n        a1 = node(w1,b1,input)\n\n        # h2 node\n        a2 = node(w2,b2,a1)\n\n        # output node\n        output = node(w3,b3,a2)\n        \n        # append to form output\n        outputs.append(output)\n    \n    return np.asarray(outputs)\n\nWe can now calculate our average loss over the entire training set:\n\nmse(simple_network(inputs),labels)\n\n1.5262278676793288"

    "section": "Multidimensional Network",
    "text": "Multidimensional Network\nWe’ve looked at a very simple example above which captures the essence of what we are doing. However, our networks are really never actually composed of layers with one element each. Instead, each layer has multiple nodes.\nTechnically, we could continue in the same way as above and individually number our weights and biases but this quickly gets out of hand! As an exercise, try repeating the above analysis and implementation where each hidden layer is now of size 2!\nIronically, to avoid this notational complexity, it seems like we must introduce additional notation, and rewrite our problem in the language of linear algebra.\nTo introduce this notation, lets imagine a network the following structure: \nTo make our analysis simpler, lets zoom in on node node, and all of its input weights:\n\nWe’ve highlighted the 0th node in our last hidden layer and all of its inputs from the previous layer in \\color{orange}{\\text{orange}}. We’ve also numbered each of it input nodes with their layer-specific numbering and shown them in \\color{blue}{\\text{blue}}.\nWe’ve also named each weight according to the following format:\n\nw_{\\;\\color{orange}{\\text{current node #}} \\;,\\; \\color{blue}{\\text{incoming node #}}}\n\nThis may seem a bit counter intuitive at first, as the tendency when reading from left to write is to want to write our weights as:\n\nw_{\\;\\color{blue}{\\text{incoming node #}} \\;,\\; \\color{orange}{\\text{current node #}} }\n\nYou absolutely can, but that will result in a bunch of transposes in later equations. To get rid of them now, we will number our weights as we did above. As is typically the case, people make seemingly weird/arbitrary decisions at the front to result in simplifications down the line.\nRecall, the function of a node is to apply its weight to the activation of its input/previous layer. In this case, we have three previous nodes/input nodes, so we will also write them in \\color{blue}{\\text{blue}} to make it clear that they are coming from the previous layer.\nSo our orange node is performing:\n\n\\color{orange}{w}_{\\color{orange}{0},\\color{blue}{0}} \\cdot \\color{blue}{a_0} +\n\\color{orange}{w}_{\\color{orange}{0},\\color{blue}{1}} \\cdot \\color{blue}{a_1} +\n\\color{orange}{w}_{\\color{orange}{0},\\color{blue}{2}} \\cdot \\color{blue}{a_2} +\n\\color{orange}{b_0}\n\nAlready, our eyes should be screaming dot-product!\n\nNotation\nIndeed, we can form a vector of the previous layer’s activations as:\n\n\\color{blue}{\\mathbf{a}_{prev}} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\color{blue}{a_0 \\\\\na_1 \\\\\na_2}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nand a vector of the 0-th neurons weights in the current layer as:\n\n\\color{orange}{\\mathbf{w}_0} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\color{orange}{w}_{\\color{orange}{0},\\color{blue}{0}} \\\\\n\\color{orange}{w}_{\\color{orange}{0},\\color{blue}{1}} \\\\\n\\color{orange}{w}_{\\color{orange}{0},\\color{blue}{2}}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nwhere we have used color again to make it clear what layer we are talking about: the current or previous layer.\nThen we can rewrite what our orange node is calculating as: \n\\begin{align}\n\\color{orange}{z_0} &= \\color{orange}{\\mathbf{w}_0} \\cdot \\color{blue}{\\mathbf{a}_{prev}} + \\color{orange}{b_0} \\\\\n\\color{orange}{a_0} &= \\sigma(\\color{orange}{z_0})\n\\end{align}\n\nWell, we’ve managed to rewrite the activation of one-node in slightly better notation. But we can we do better! Lets now reason about the entire layer!\nRecall, we already have a vector of the previous layer’s activations in \\color{blue}{\\mathbf{a}_{prev}}, although we never actually gave a formula for it. Based on the formula for the 0th-node in the current layer we just gave, lets try to give a vector of activations for the entire current layer.\n(Note: to prevent a color explosion, since we’re talking about the current layer, I will drop orange to refer to it most places. I will keep blue to refer to the previous layer).\nTo simplify our analysis, lets first note that: \n\\mathbf{a}_{curr} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\sigma (z_0) \\\\\n\\sigma (z_1) \\\\\n\\sigma (z_2) \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix} =\n\\sigma\\left(\\;\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nz_0 \\\\\nz_1 \\\\\nz_2 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\\;\n\\right) =\n\\sigma (\\mathbf{z}_{curr})\n\nSo, lets focus on writing a formula for the vector \\mathbf{z}_{curr}:\n\n\\mathbf{z}_{curr} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\mathbf{w}_0 \\cdot \\color{blue}{\\mathbf{a}_{prev}} + b_0 \\\\\n\\mathbf{w}_1 \\cdot \\color{blue}{\\mathbf{a}_{prev}} + b_1 \\\\\n\\mathbf{w}_2 \\cdot \\color{blue}{\\mathbf{a}_{prev}} + b_2 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nLets make it a bit clearer by writing our biases for the entire layer as a separate vector \\mathbf{b}:\n\n\\mathbf{z}_{curr} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\mathbf{w}_0 \\cdot \\color{blue}{\\mathbf{a}_{prev}} \\\\\n\\mathbf{w}_1 \\cdot \\color{blue}{\\mathbf{a}_{prev}} \\\\\n\\mathbf{w}_2 \\cdot \\color{blue}{\\mathbf{a}_{prev}}  \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n+\n\\mathbf{b}\n\nJust like we saw when we discussed linear regression, this vector of dot products is exactly the matrix-vector product of the weight matrix and the previous layers activation vector!\n\nDefinition: The current layers weight matrix: \\mathbf{W} is a matrix of k-many rows, and j-many columns, where k is the number of nodes in the current layer, and j is the number of nodes in the previous layer:\n\n\\mathbf{W} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{k,j}=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\mathbf{w}_0^T \\\\\n\\mathbf{w}_1^T \\\\\n\\ldots \\\\\n\\mathbf{w}_k^T\n\\end{bmatrix} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nw_{0,0} & w_{0,1} & \\ldots & w_{0,j} \\\\\n\\ldots \\\\\nw_{k,0} & w_{0,1} & \\ldots & w_{k,j} \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nNote: each row of the weight matrix represents all inputs to a specific node in the current layer.\n\nNow, we can finally write a complete linear algebraic equation for the function of a current layer on a previous layer:\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathbf{z}_{curr} &= \\mathbf{W}\\color{blue}{\\mathbf{a}_{prev}}+\\mathbf{b} \\\\\n\\mathbf{a}_{curr} &= \\sigma(\\mathbf{z}_{curr})\n\\end{align}\n\nNow, neural networks do this sequentially, so the last piece of the puzzle is to be able to refer to a specific layer by number. We now introduce the final piece of notation to let us do this: a superscript to designate the layer number:\n\nThe activation of layer L is given by:\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathbf{z}^L &= \\mathbf{W}^L \\mathbf{a}^{L-1}+\\mathbf{b}^L \\\\\n\\mathbf{a}^L &= \\sigma(\\mathbf{z}^L)\n\\end{align}\n\nThis is often written succinctly as:\n\n\\boxed{\\mathbf{a}^L = \\sigma(\\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{a}^{L-1} + \\mathbf{b})}\n\nwhere the specific \\mathbf{W},\\mathbf{b} we are talking about is implied.\n\n Wow we’ve come a long way! We’ve given a very clear and succinct linear algebraic equation for the entire forward direction for a network of any number of layers and size of each layer!\nLets perform a size sanity check: * \\mathbf{W} is of size k \\times j, where j is the number of neurons in the previous layer. * \\mathbf{a}^{L-1} is a vector of size j \\times 1, the activations of the previous layer. * Their multiplication results in a vector of size k \\times 1, where k is the number of neurons in the current layer. * Our bias vector is also k \\times 1 (as we expect!).\nSo everything works as expected!\nThis is why we decided to write our weight matrix to be of size k \\times j or \\text{# neurons in prev layer} \\times \\text{# neurons in current layer} instead of the other way around. If we had, we’d need a transpose in the equation above.\n\n\n\nImplementation\nArmed with our new notation, lets write an implementation of the network we gave above:\n\n\n🧐Pause-and-ponder: What should the sizes of each W be for this network? Lets go through it together!\n\nOk! Now lets implement it!\n\ninputs,labels = toy()\n\n\ndef simple_network2(inputs):\n    outputs = []\n    N = inputs.shape[0]\n    \n    # initialize weight matrices - notice the dimensions\n    W_1 = np.random.randn(3,1)\n    W_2 = np.random.randn(2,3)\n    W_3 = np.random.randn(1,2)\n    \n    # and our biases\n    b_1 = np.random.randn(3,1)\n    b_2 = np.random.randn(2,1)\n    b_3 = np.random.randn(1,1)\n    \n    # loop through training data\n    for i in range(N):\n        \n        # correct size for current input\n        input = inputs[i,:]\n        \n        # layer 1\n        a_1 = sigmoid(W_1*input + b_1)\n\n        # layer 2\n        a_2 = sigmoid(W_2.dot(a_1)+b_2)\n\n        # output layer\n        output = sigmoid(W_3.dot(a_2)+b_3)\n        \n        # append to form output\n        outputs.append(output)\n    \n    return np.squeeze(np.asarray(outputs)).reshape(-1,1)\n\n\noutputs = simple_network2(inputs)\nplt.scatter(inputs,outputs,c=labels);"

    "text": "Mini-Batch Notation\nNote, this implementation runs an example through the network one-by-one! Instead, we can imagine feeding our entire dataset through at once! This formalism will pave the way for us later to feed in a mini-batch at a time.\nLets just reason our way through this one from first-principles (fancy way to say: lets match our matrix sizes!), seeing how we get our entire dataset through the first hidden layer.\nThe first weight matrix is of size:\n\n\\mathbf{W}_1: (\\text{size of hidden layer} \\times \\text{dimension of input})\n\nwhich in this case is: 3 \\times 1. If our input was 2-D, it would be 3 \\times 2. So what we dot it with, needs to be of size: \\text{dimension of input} \\times \\text{??}.\nIts in that dimension that we can place our entire dataset!\nSo, now we’re going to be shuffling activation matrices around! In these activation matrices, each column is an activation for the last layer on a different training example!\n\nSo we expect the first activation matrix to be of size: \\text{dimension of input} \\times \\text{number of samples}. This means this must also be the size of the initial input matrix for the first hidden layer.\nSo, we can rewrite our layer propagation equation above for our entire dataset:\n\n\\boxed{\\mathbf{A}^L = \\sigma(\\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{A}^{L-1} + \\mathbf{b})}\n\nwhere we use broadcasting rules to let us add a vector \\mathbf{b} to a matrix.\n\nLets make a special note about the first hidden layer, and how it processes our input matrix.\nTypically, we imagine our data matrix such that the first dimension is the batch_size:\n\nThis means each row of this matrix, corresponds to one sample.\nSo if our data matrix is of size \\text{batch_size} \\times \\text{dimension}, in order for our first layer to calculate correctly, we have to make the sizes work! Meaning, our first layer should be:\n\n\\mathbf{A}^1 = \\sigma(\\mathbf{W}^1\\mathbf{X}^T + \\mathbf{b})\n\nwhere X^T is:\n\n\nNote: Here we define the input matrix X to be of size: N \\times d. That is why we transpose it in the first layer. This is by no means universal, and different numerical libraries do it differently. You might come across libraries or papers to talks, where the input matrix is defined to be of size d \\times N. If that is the case, the first layer does not need an X^T!\n\nNow we can implement this simple network, using this notation!\n\ndef simple_network2_batch(inputs):\n    # assume inputs is of shape Nxd\n    \n    # initialize weight matrices - notice the dimensions\n    W_1 = np.random.randn(3,1)\n    W_2 = np.random.randn(2,3)\n    W_3 = np.random.randn(1,2)\n    \n    # and our biases\n    b_1 = np.random.randn(3,1)\n    b_2 = np.random.randn(2,1)\n    b_3 = np.random.randn(1,1)\n    \n    # NOTE - there is no for loop here! \n    \n    # layer 1\n    a_1 = sigmoid(W_1.dot(X.T) + b_1)\n\n    # layer 2\n    a_2 = sigmoid(W_2.dot(a_1)+b_2)\n\n    # output layer\n    output = sigmoid(W_3.dot(a_2)+b_3)\n    \n    return np.squeeze(np.asarray(outputs)).reshape(-1,1)\n\nNow lets actually run our entire dataset through (since we aren’t yet dealing with batches), to generate outputs:\n\ninputs,labels = toy()\ny_hat = outputs = simple_network2(inputs)\n\nJust for fun, lets plot it!\n\nfig,(ax1,ax2) = plt.subplots(1,2,figsize=(15,7))\nax1.set_title('Original poits and labels')\nax1.scatter(inputs,labels);\n\nax1.set_title('Original poits and Y_Hat')\nax2.scatter(inputs,outputs,color='orange');\n\n\n\n\nNote the huge difference in our y-axis! This is without and training so its bound to be bad!\n\nPause-and-ponder: Go back and re run the network above and re-plot the final representation. Notice how random it is!

    "section": "Dealing with Biases",
    "text": "Dealing with Biases\nAnother very common notational trick people do, as we saw in linear regression, was to add “another dimension” to “automatically” deal with our bias.\nHere, that means adding another “node” to each layer. This node has no input, only outputs, and its activation is always the value 1.\n\n\nQuestion: How does this act as a bias?\n\nWell, lets look at what this means for a particular node. Lets once again highlight the orange node:\n\nWhat effect does this have for this orange nodes update? Well, lets write out what it is:\n\nSo, \\color{orange}{w}_{\\color{orange}{0},\\color{blue}{3}} is always being multiplied by the value 1. This is exactly the role of the bias!\n\nAs we can see, the addition of a constant node in a layer gives an extra weight to each node in the next layer. This weight, multiplied by 1, acts as the bias for each node.\nSo all we have to do, is add an extra column to each weight matrix in our network. (Note: often, this bias is omitted from the final layer).\nNow, for a layer L, the weight matrix is of size: k \\times j+1, where k is the number of actual/real hidden nodes in layer L, and j is the number of actual/real hidden nodes in layer L-1.\nNote: often this is drawn with the bias nodes on top of the others, not below.\n\nSo we would think of the 0-th weight acting as the bias, so we would add an extra column to the left/right of each weight matrix. Its ultimately the same thing\nAs a sanity check that this works, lets compare the output of the previous implementation with this new notation. To do so, we need to make sure they use the same initialization. Lets take it out of the function and “make it flat” so we can easily compare:\n\n# W and b network\n# initialize weight matrices - notice the dimensions\nW_1 = np.random.randn(3,1)\nW_2 = np.random.randn(2,3)\nW_3 = np.random.randn(1,2)\n\n# and our biases\nb_1 = np.random.randn(3,1)\nb_2 = np.random.randn(2,1)\nb_3 = np.random.randn(1,1)\n\n\n# W network - adding biases to the right:\nW_1_b = np.hstack((W_1,b_1))\nW_2_b = np.hstack((W_2,b_2))\nW_3_b = np.hstack((W_3,b_3))\n\nLets run the “old network” notation:\n\n# layer 1\na_1_old = sigmoid(W_1.dot(inputs.T) + b_1)\n\n# layer 2\na_2_old = sigmoid(W_2.dot(a_1_old)+b_2)\n\n# output layer\noutput_old = sigmoid(W_3.dot(a_2_old)+b_3)\noutput_old = np.squeeze(np.asarray(output_old)).reshape(-1,1)\n\nAnd now the “new” network notation. Note: in order to run the inputs through, we need to add the “extra dimension of 1’s”, as we’ve done many times before!\n\ninputs_new = np.c_[inputs,np.ones(inputs.shape[0])]\n\nNow we can go ahead and “feed it in”\n\n# layer 1\na_1_new = sigmoid(W_1_b.dot(inputs_new.T))\n# append the 1 to the end of the previous layers activations:\na_1_new = np.r_[a_1_new, np.ones((1,a_1_new.shape[1]))]\n\n# layer 2\na_2_new = sigmoid(W_2_b.dot(a_1_new))\n# append the 1 to the end of the previous layers activations:\na_2_new = np.r_[a_2_new, np.ones((1,a_2_new.shape[1]))]\n\n# output layer\noutput_new = sigmoid(W_3_b.dot(a_2_new))\noutput_new = np.squeeze(np.asarray(output_new)).reshape(-1,1)\n\nLets verify they are both equal:\n\nnp.equal(output_new,output_old).all()\n\nFalse\n\n\n\nNote: This might seem like a strange hack - We have to reshape each layers weight matrix, and each layers activation matrix to account for this extra “1” flying around everywhere.\nI will not try to convince you one way or the other which makes the most sense. I’m just explaining it here in case it is useful to you to think of the bias as “being wrapped up” in our weight matrix, as it was when we discussed linear regression.\nMoving forward, we will not be using this notation in the rest of the notebook."

With linear activation functions, all we are able to do is calculate some linear combination of our inputs!\nLets dig in a bit more, and show what we are actually calculating at Layer L:\n\nA^L = W_3((W_2(W_1X^T + b_1) + b_2) + b_3\n\nWell, lets distribute this out: \nA^L = W_3W_2W_1X^T + W_3W_2b_1 + W_3b_2 + b_3\n\nOk, wait a second… this is getting confusing - lets check to make sure the sizes work out!\n\n\nLets go through this part together in class!\n\nOk! We can see that the sizes do in fact work out!\n\n🧐Pause-and-ponder: In your resulting equation, perform some clarifying substitutions. What do we discover?\n\nAfter some substitutions, we can write an equation like the following:\n\n\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}} = \\mathbf{W}^*X^T + \\mathbf{b}^*\n\nWhich tells us that a NN with only linear activations, is ultimately just another linear function of its inputs! It doesn’t matter how deep or wide it is!\n\n\nA Final Sigmoid\nGiven our understanding above, what would happen if we only add a sigmoid at the end? Something like:\n\n\n🧐Pause-and-ponder: What do you think it represents? What is its representational capacity?"

    "section": "1-D Case",
    "text": "1-D Case\nNote: This presentation follows very closely these two fantastic resources * 3blue1brown - Backpropagation calculus * Michael Nielsen - Neural Networks and Deep Learning - Chapter 2\nLets revisit the simplest network we started with at the beginning of this notebook:\n\nNotation Note: we’re introducing a new notation \\color{blue}{w_3 = w^L, w_2 = w^{L-1}}, \\ldots and we will be using them interchangeably.\nTo focus our discussion, lets just focus on the last two levels, and label their activation values:\n\nThe output layer defines the “representation” our network has created for a specific input:\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\zl &= \\wl\\ap+\\bl \\\\\n\\al &= \\sigma(\\zl)\n\\end{align}\n\nWhere now we are using color to denote the kind of variable we are talking about. For example, activations for any layer are green.\nSo, its with this layers activation that we want to measure our cost, on a specific example x_0 run through our network:\n\n\\czero = (\\al - y)^2\n\nAnother way to think about this process, is as this computational graph:\n\nThis tells a “causal” story, about what variables are needed to compute other variables. Note: this could be carried even further back through the network, all the way to the inputs!\n\nNote: This is a “light weight”/conceptual computational graph. Its a way to introduce the concept of backpropagating partial derivatives through a graph using the chain rule.\n\nLets try to understand exactly what a “partial derivative” like \\dcdw{L} is telling us, by associating a little number line with each of these variables:\n\nPictorially, this is telling us that a little nudge to a weight, results in a nudge to the “activity”/\\zl of the neuron (Q: how big/how small of a nudge?), which then results in a nudge to the activation/\\al of the neuron (Q: how big/how small of a nudge?) which then results in a nudge to the total cost of the network (how big/how small of a nudge?).\nSo conceptually, the partial \\dcdw{L} is capturing:\n\n\nSimulation\nWe actually go ahead and simulate this to better understand what its telling us! Lets start by running an example through our network:\n\ninputs,outputs = toy()\ninput,output = inputs[0],outputs[0]\n\n\n# initialize weights\nw_1 = np.random.randn()\nw_2 = np.random.randn()\nw_3 = 1 #exagerating for plotting purposes\n\n# and our biases\nb_1 = np.random.randn()\nb_2 = np.random.randn()\nb_3 = np.random.randn()\n\n\n# layer 1\nz_1 = w_1*input+b_1\na_1 = sigmoid(z_1)\n\n# layer 2\nz_2 = w_2*a_1+b_2\na_2 = sigmoid(z_2)\n\n# output layer\nz_3 = w_3*a_2+b_3\na_3 = sigmoid(z_3)\n\n\ncost_0 = (output - a_3)**2\n\n\n\nNudge \\color{blue}{w^L}\nNow lets give \\wl a “little nudge”, and see how it propagates through the network!\nNote: This is not really a little nudge. Ive greatly exaggerated it to provide a good looking plot.\n\nnudge = np.linspace(-5,5,51)\nz_3_nudged = (w_3 + nudge)*a_2 + b_3\na_3_nudged = sigmoid(z_3_nudged)\ncost_0_nudged = (a_3_nudged - output)**2\n\nLets plot it!\n\nfig, (ax1,ax2,ax3) = plt.subplots(1,3,figsize=(20,7),sharex=True)\nax1.plot(w_3+nudge,z_3_nudged,c=\"orange\");\nax1.scatter(w_3,w_3*a_2+b_3,s=100,c='orange');\nax1.set_xlabel('w_3 + nudge');\nax1.set_ylabel('z_3');\nax1.set_title(\"How a nudge in w_3 affects z_3\")\n\nax2.plot(w_3+nudge, a_3_nudged,c='green');\nax2.scatter(w_3,sigmoid(w_3*a_2+b_3),s=100,c='green');\nax2.set_xlabel('w_3 + nudge');\nax2.set_ylabel('a_3');\nax2.set_title(\"How a nudge in a_3 affects z_3\")\n\nax3.plot(w_3+nudge, cost_0_nudged,c='red');\nax3.scatter(w_3,(sigmoid(w_3*a_2+b_3)-output)**2,s=100,c='red');\nax3.set_xlabel('w_3 + nudge');\nax3.set_ylabel('C_0');\nax3.set_title(\"How a nudge in w_3 affects C_0\");\n\n\n\n\nWhat is this telling us? That a little nudge in w_3 results in very different changes to each the variables down our computational graph!\n\n\nNudge \\color{blue}{w_1}\nLets repeat this simulation, except go more back/backer to see how a nudge at w_1 affects our output layer and our cost!\n\nnudge = np.linspace(-5,5,51)\nz_1_nudged = (w_1 + nudge)*input + b_1\na_1_nudged = sigmoid(z_1_nudged)\n\nz_2_nudged = w_2*a_1_nudged + b_2\na_2_nudged = sigmoid(z_2_nudged)\n\nz_3_nudged = w_3*a_2_nudged + b_3\na_3_nudged = sigmoid(z_3_nudged)\n\ncost_0_nudged = (a_3_nudged - output)**2\n\nPlot it!\n\nfig, (ax1,ax2,ax3) = plt.subplots(1,3,figsize=(20,7),sharex=True)\n\nax1.plot(w_1+nudge,z_1_nudged,c=\"orange\");\nax1.scatter(w_1,w_1*input+b_1,s=100,c='orange');\nax1.set_xlabel('W+nudge');\nax1.set_ylabel('z_1');\nax1.set_title(\"How a nudge in w_1 affects z_1\")\n\nax2.plot(w_1+nudge, a_3_nudged,c='green');\nax2.scatter(w_1,sigmoid(w_3*(sigmoid(w_2*sigmoid(w_1*input+b_1)+b_2))+b_3),s=100,c='green');\nax2.set_xlabel('W+nudge');\nax2.set_ylabel('a_3');\nax2.set_title(\"How a nudge in w_1 affects a_3\")\n\nax3.plot(w_1+nudge, cost_0_nudged,c='red');\nax3.scatter(w_1,(sigmoid(w_3*(sigmoid(w_2*sigmoid(w_1*input+b_1)+b_2))+b_3)-output)**2,s=100,c='red');\nax3.set_xlabel('W+nudge');\nax3.set_ylabel('C_0');\nax3.set_title(\"How a nudge in w_1 affects our cost\");\n\n\n\n\nAh, these graphs have are a bit more interesting, so we can point out the following:\nImplicit in all of these graphs are the following idea:\n\n\\frac{\\text{the amount of change in a dependent variable}}{\\text{the amount of change in a variable that it depends on}}\n\nWell, this is just the rate of change of the graph! Which we might remember! Lets restate this idea for each subplot:\nThe specific rate of change for the first subplot is:\n\n\\frac{\\text{resulting change in }\\color{orange}{z_1}}{\\text{some amount of change in } \\color{blue}{w_1}} = \\frac{\\color{orange}{\\Delta z_1}}{\\color{blue}{\\Delta w_1}}\n\nThe specific rate of change for the second subplot is:\n\n\\frac{\\text{resulting change in }\\color{green}{a_3}}{\\text{some amount of change in } \\color{blue}{w_1}} = \\frac{\\color{green}{\\Delta a_3}}{\\color{blue}{\\Delta w_1}}\n\nThe specific rate of change for the third subplot is:\n\n\\frac{\\text{resulting change in } \\color{red}{C_0}}{\\text{some amount of change in } \\color{blue}{w_1}} = \\frac{\\color{red}{\\Delta C_0}}{\\color{blue}{\\Delta w_1}}\n\nAha! That last subplot is telling us something about how sensitive the cost \\czero is to changes in \\wone. This is what we want!\nWe can see that a little change to \\wone to the left/right (depends on random vals), results in a big change to our final cost on this example!\nThis rate of change/derivative tells us the direction we need to change \\wone in order to reduce our costs!\n\n\n\nWe could do better\nNow, from the plotting code for the last subplot up there you might notice that to generate that last subplot, we basically had to run the entire nudged \\wone + \\Delta all the way through our entire network!\nWe are also reasoning about the derivative by looking at a graph, instead of actually calculating it so that we can use it.\nLets see if we can think of a clever scheme of actually calculating our partials with respect to our weights: \\ldots,\\dcdw{L-1},\\dcdw{L}, by starting with\n\n\\dcdw{L} = ?\n\nLets bring back our computational graph:\n\nLets use the following idea to decompose our graph starting from the end/bottom:\n\n\\frac{\\text{the amount of change in a dependent variable}}{\\text{the amount of change in a variable that it depends on}}\n\n\nStarting at \\czero, we have:\n\n\\dcda{L}\n\nThis object tells us how the cost changes with respect to the final layers activation. Lets calculate it:\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\czero &= (\\al - y)^2 \\\\\n\\dcda{L}  &= 2(\\al -y)\n\\end{align}\n\nWhat happens if \\al is small? Well then it contributes less to our error!\nSo we should focus on making sure that when \\al is large, its correct!\n\n🧐Pause-and-ponder: What about \\frac{\\czero}{\\partial y} ? What can we say about this?\n\n\nAccording to our computational graph, thats all of the immediate “independent” variables \\czero has. So lets now switch our focus to \\al:\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\al &= \\sigma (\\zl) \\\\\n\\dadz{L} &= \\sigma ^{\\color{red}{\\prime}}(\\zl)\n\\end{align}\n\nwhere \\sigma^{\\color{red}{\\prime}}(\\cdot) is the derivative of our sigmoid activation function:\n\n\\sigma^{\\color{red}{\\prime}}(\\cdot) = \\sigma(\\cdot)(1-\\sigma(\\cdot))\n\nThis lets us rewrite the above as:\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\dadz{L} &= \\sigma(\\zl)(1-\\sigma(\\zl))\n\\end{align}\n\n\nWe now have the following partials:\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\dcda{L} &: \\text{how changing } \\al \\text{ changes } \\czero \\\\ \\\\\n\\dadz{L} &: \\text{how changing } \\zl \\text{ changes } \\al\n\\end{align}\n\nIt shouldn’t require too much convincing that we can multiply these two objects together to create a new partial:\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\dcda{L} \\cdot \\dadz{L} &= \\dcdz{L} \\\\\n                        &= \\text{how changing } \\zl \\text{ changes } \\czero\n\\end{align}\n\nIndeed, the notation itself suggests this by allowing us to “cancel out” partials that appear on top and on bottom:\n\n\n\nThe last step is to actually write this out to get an expression for \\dcdz{L}:\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\dcdz{L} &= \\dadz{L} \\cdot \\dcda{L} \\\\\n         &= \\underbrace{\\sigma(\\zl)(1-\\sigma(\\zl))}_{\\text{how changing }\\zl\\text{ affects }\\al} \\cdot  \\underbrace{2(\\al -y)}_{\\text{how changing }\\al\\text{ affects }\\czero}\n\\end{align}\n\n\n🧐Pause-and-ponder: We have just discovered and applied the chain rule! We have used it to backpropagate a change at the output of our last layer: \\dcda{L}, to a change at the input of the activation function of our last layer: \\dadz{L}.\n\n\n📖Semi-Definition: Backpropagation can be thought of as applying the chain rule back across our computational graph!\n\n\n\n\nLets keep going!\nSo far we’ve backpropagated once. Lets look at our map so far:\n\nLets keep backpropagating (chain-ruling)! We can now look at the inputs \\zl has. Lets focus on one of the most interesting for right now, \\wl:\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\zl &= \\wl\\ax{L-1}+\\bl \\\\\n\\dzdw{L} &= \\ax{L-1}\n\\end{align}\n\n\n🧐Pause-and-ponder: This derivative has a particularly interesting interpretation. Its saying that the amount a nudge to our weight in the last layer influences the “activity” of the last layer, depends on how strong the previous neuron was firing! In other words, if the previous neuron was very active, even a small nudge could cause big changes! But if the previous neuron was always low activation/low firing, then this weight doesn’t really matter!\nNote: This observation is often stated as:\n\n“Neurons that fire together, wire together”,\n“Weights between low activation neurons learn very slowly”\n\n\nWith this, we can chain it together with our other partials to write an expression for \\dcdw{L}:\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\dcdw{L} &= \\dzdw{L}\\dcdz{L}\\\\ \\\\\n         &= \\dzdw{L}\\dadz{L}\\dcda{L} \\\\ \\\\\n         &= \\underbrace{\\ax{L-1}}_{\\text{how changing }\\wl\\text{ affects } \\zl} \\quad \\underbrace{\\sigma(\\zl)(1-\\sigma(\\zl))}_{\\text{how changing }\\zl\\text{ affects }\\al} \\quad \\underbrace{2(\\al -y)}_{\\text{how changing }\\al\\text{ affects }\\czero}\n\\end{align}\n\nOr simply:\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\dcdw{L} &= \\dzdw{L}\\dadz{L}\\dcda{L} \\\\\n         &= \\left(\\ax{L-1}\\right) \\left(\\sigma(\\zl)(1-\\sigma(\\zl))\\right) \\left(2(\\al -y)\\right)\n\\end{align}\n\n\n🧐Pause-and-ponder: From here, can you guess the appropriate equation for \\dcdb{L}?\nHint:\n\n\\frac{\\dc}{?} = \\frac{\\dz{L}}{?}\\dadz{L}\\dcda{L}\n\n\n\nWow! We’ve come a long way! We finally have an actual expression for how a change to one of our weights (\\wl) causes a change to our cost for a single example.\n\nLets finish up by using the hint I gave above\n\n\\frac{\\dc}{?} = \\frac{\\dz{L}}{?}\\dadz{L}\\dcda{L}\n\nto find an expression for how the cost changes with respect to the previous layers activity \\dcda{L-1}:\n\n\\dcda{L-1} = \\underbrace{\\frac{\\dz{L}}{\\da{L-1}}}_{\\text{need to calculate}}\\underbrace{\\dadz{L}\\dcda{L}}_{\\text{already have this}}\n\nSo all we need is an expression for \\frac{\\dz{L}}{\\da{L-1}}:\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\zl &= \\wl\\ax{L-1}+\\bl \\\\\n\\frac{\\dz{L}}{\\da{L-1}} &= \\wl\n\\end{align}\n\nLetting us write:\n\n\\dcda{L-1} = \\left(\\wl\\right) \\left(\\sigma(\\zl)(1-\\sigma(\\zl))\\right) \\left(2(\\al -y)\\right)\n\nFor completion, and as an answer to a previous pause-and-ponder, lets write out the expression for \\dcdb{L}:\n\n\\dcdb{L} = \\dzdb{L}\\dadz{L}\\dcda{L}\n\nWe can get an expression for \\dzdb{L}:\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\zl      &= \\wl\\ax{L-1}+\\bl \\\\\n\\dzdb{L} &= 1\n\\end{align}\n\nAnd so \n\\begin{align}\n\\dcdb{L} &= 1\\cdot\\dadz{L}\\dcda{L}\\\\\n         &= \\left(\\sigma(\\zl)(1-\\sigma(\\zl))\\right) \\left(2(\\al -y)\\right)\n\\end{align}\n\nLets group this level all together to write all partials for this level:\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\dcdw{L}   &= \\left(\\ax{L-1}\\right) &&\\cdot&\\left(\\sigma(\\zl)(1-\\sigma(\\zl))\\right) \\left(2(\\al -y)\\right) \\\\\n\\dcdb{L}   &= 1 &&\\cdot&\\left(\\sigma(\\zl)(1-\\sigma(\\zl))\\right) \\left(2(\\al -y)\\right) \\\\\n\\dcda{L-1} &=\\left(\\wl\\right) &&\\cdot&\\left(\\sigma(\\zl)(1-\\sigma(\\zl))\\right) \\left(2(\\al -y)\\right)\n\\end{align}\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking of Error…\nAha! We can notice they all have something in common:\n\n\\dcdz{L}=\\dadz{L}\\dcda{L}\n\n\nDefinition: The error associated with layer L is given by:\n\n\\deltal = \\dcdz{L}=\\dadz{L}\\dcda{L}\n\noften stated simply as:\n\n\\deltal = \\dcdz{L}\n\nand completely as:\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\deltal &= \\sigma(\\zl)(1-\\sigma(\\zl)) (\\al -y) \\\\\n        &= \\sigma^{\\color{red}{\\prime}}(\\zl) (\\al-y)\n\\end{align}\n\nNote: We’ve discarded that 2 from the cost as is often done.\n\n\n🧐Pause-and-ponder: Why is this called the error?\n\nThis lets rewrite our partials as:\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\dcdw{L}   &= \\ax{L-1} \\deltal \\\\\n\\dcdb{L}   &= \\deltal \\\\\n\\dcda{L-1} &= \\wl \\deltal\n\\end{align}\n\n\n\n\nWhat about the rest?\nAnd thats it! We’ve finally finished out how our cost function changes with respect to one layer: L. But we’ve only done one layer! Not to worry! We’ve discovered backpropagation and the chain rule! So the rest is easy!\nLets look at our map\n\nWe’ve boxed in what we know how to do so far. This also tells us its very straight forward to now give the equations for layer L-1:\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\dcdw{L-1} &= \\dzdw{L-1} \\dadz{L-1} \\dcda{L-1} \\\\\n\\dcdb{L-1} &= \\dzdb{L-1} \\dadz{L-1} \\dcda{L-1} \\\\\n\\dcda{L-2} &= \\frac{\\dz{L-1}}{\\da{L-2}} \\dadz{L-1} \\dcda{L-1}\n\\end{align}\n\n\n\n\nFully recursive definition\nWow! We again see they have something in common!\n\nDefinition: The error for layer L-1 is:\n\n\\deltax{L-1} = \\dcdz{L-1}=\\dadz{L-1}\\dcda{L-1}\n\noften stated simply as:\n\n\\deltax{L-1} = \\dcdz{L-1}\n\n\nWe can now restate the above as:\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\dcdw{L-1} &= \\ax{L-2} \\deltax{L-1} \\\\\n\\dcdb{L-1} &=  \\deltax{L-1} \\\\\n\\dcda{L-2} &= \\wx{L-1} \\deltax{L-1}\n\\end{align}\n\nThat is a recursive definition that serves for the rest of the graph!\n\n\n\nBut wait…\nTheres more! Lets bring back the definitions of error for layer L-1, and the partials for layer L:\nPartials at layer L:\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\dcdw{L}   &= \\ax{L-1} \\deltal \\\\\n\\dcdb{L}   &= \\deltal \\\\\n\\dcda{L-1} &= \\wl \\deltal\n\\end{align}\n\nError at layer L-1:\n\n\\deltax{L-1} = \\dcdz{L-1}=\\dadz{L-1}\\dcda{L-1}\n\nAha! We see something in common again!\n\n\\boxed{\\dcda{L-1} = \\wl \\deltal}\n\n\n\\deltax{L-1} = \\dcdz{L-1}=\\dadz{L-1}\\boxed{\\dcda{L-1}}\n\nLets sub that in and write:\n\n\\deltax{L-1} = \\dcdz{L-1}=\\dadz{L-1}\\wl \\deltal\n\nWe’ve discovered another major equation!:\n\n📖 Definition: The error at any layer L-1 can be written as a function of the next layer L:\n\n\\deltax{L-1} = \\wl \\deltal \\cdot \\sigma^{\\color{red}{\\prime}}(\\zx{L-1})\n\n\nFor example, for layer L-2:\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\deltax{L-2} &= \\wx{L-1}\\deltax{L-1}\\sigma^{\\color{red}{\\prime}}(\\zx{L-2}) \\\\\n             &= \\wx{L-1}\\left[  \\wl \\deltal \\cdot \\sigma^{\\color{red}{\\prime}}(\\zx{L-1}) \\right]\\sigma^{\\color{red}{\\prime}}(\\zx{L-2})\n\\end{align}\n\n\n\n\nThe Four Fundamental Backpropagation Equations™\nWe did it! We’ve completed backprop on this simple 1D network!\n\nLets cap this off by rewriting scalar versions of the four fundamental backpropagation equations:\n\n📖Definition: Scalar versions of the Four Fundamental Backpropagation Equations™ are given by:\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\delta^L &= (\\al-y) \\cdot \\sigma^{\\color{red}{\\prime}}(\\zl)  \\tag{BP1} \\\\\n\\deltax{\\ell} &= \\wx{l+1} \\delta^{\\ell+1} \\cdot \\sigma^{\\color{red}{\\prime}}(\\zx{\\ell}) \\tag{BP2} \\\\\n\\dcdb{\\ell} &= \\delta^{\\ell} \\tag{BP3} \\\\\n\\dcdw{\\ell} &= \\ax{\\ell-1}\\delta^{\\ell} \\tag{BP4}\n\\end{align}\n\nwhere \\ell is any layer.\n\nSome explanation of each:\n\nBP1 defines the error for the last layer. This is the first thing we calculate to perform backprop.\nBP2 defines the error for any layer \\ell in terms of the error at the next level \\ell+1.\nBP3 defines the bias update at any layer \\ell\nBP4 defines the weight update at any layer \\ell\n\nBP2 and BP4 have interesting interpretations which will become more salient when we get to matrices/vectors, but that we can first describe here:\n\nLets start with BP2:\n\n\\deltax{\\ell} = \\wx{l+1} \\delta^{\\ell+1} \\cdot \\sigma^{\\color{red}{\\prime}}(\\zx{\\ell})\n\nWe can think of this as the backprop equation, as it clearly captures the backward flow of errors from outputs back through the network!\nYou can also think of BP2 as saying the following: Just as \\wx{\\ell+1} acted on the activation of the previous layer \\ax{l} to bring it forward to the current layer, it acts on the error of the current layer to bring it back to the previous layer!\nNote: This will become a bit more intutive when we get to matrices, as we will see this equation will have a weight matrix in the forward direction, and a transpose in the reverse direction\n\nLets rewrite BP4 as:\n\n\\dcdw{} = \\color{green}{a_{in}}\\delta_{out}\n\nwhere it’s understood that \\color{green}{a_{in}} is the activation of the neuron input to the weight w, and \\delta_{out} is the error of the neuron output from the weight w.\nClearly, when \\color{green}{a_{in}} is small, then \\dcdw{} is small. This is another way to say that this weight learns slowly, meaning that it’s not changing much during gradient descent. In other words, one consequence of BP4 is that weights output from low-activation neurons learn slowly.\n\n🧐Pause-and-ponder: What else can we say? Think about what these equations are telling us!\n\n\n\nImplementation\nWe’re now ready to go ahead and implement backprop ourselves!\n\n💪🏽Exercise: Implement this procedure on our toy example!\n\n\ndef backprop_1D():\n    # EDIT HERE\n    return\n\n\n# Step 0: fix all FP values: a1, a2, a3 and all parameters\n# Step 1: calculate delta_L\n\n\n🧐Pause-and-ponder: Once we’ve implemented these equations and calculated our partials all the way back through our network, what do we do?!"

For example, \\color{green}{a_j^L} is neuron {j}, in layer L, and \\color{blue}{w_{{j},{k}}^L} is the weight that connects neuron {k} in layer L-1 to neuron {j} in layer L.\nNow, the cost of a single example \\czero is a sum over the activations of all neurons in the last layer:\n\n\\czero = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{{j}} (\\color{green}{a_j^L}- y_{{j}})^2\n\nwhich in vector notation is:\n\n\\czero = \\frac{1}{2}\\|\\color{green}{\\mathbf{a}}^L - \\mathbf{y}\\|^2\n\nBefore going into vector/matrix notation, lets still deal with an individual weight in this network: \\color{blue}{w_{{j},{k}}^L}, and write out our backprop equation for this single weight:\n\n\\frac{\\dc}{\\color{blue}{\\partial w_{{j},{k}}^L}}= \\frac{\\color{orange}{\\partial z_j^L}}{\\color{blue}{\\partial w_{{j},{k}}^L}}\\frac{\\color{green}{\\partial \\color{green}{a_j^L}}}{\\color{orange}{\\partial z_j^L}}\\frac{\\dc}{\\color{green}{\\partial \\color{green}{a_j^L}}}\n\nFor completion, lets write expressions for each of its pieces.\nFor \\frac{\\dc}{\\color{green}{\\partial \\color{green}{a_j^L}}}:\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\czero &= \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{{j}} (\\color{green}{a_j^L}- y_{{j}})^2 \\\\\n\\frac{\\dc}{\\color{green}{\\partial \\color{green}{a_j^L}}}&= (\\color{green}{a_j^L}- y_j)\n\\end{align}\n\nFor \\frac{\\color{green}{\\partial \\color{green}{a_j^L}}}{\\color{orange}{\\partial z_j^L}}: \n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\color{green}{\\partial \\color{green}{a_j^L}}}{\\color{orange}{\\partial z_j^L}}= \\sigma(\\color{orange}{z_j^L})(1-\\color{orange}{z_j^L})\n\\end{align}\n\nFor \\frac{\\color{orange}{\\partial z_j^L}}{\\color{blue}{\\partial w_{{j},{k}}^L}}: \n\\begin{align}\n\\color{orange}{z_j^L}&= \\ldots + \\color{blue}{w_{{j},{k}}^L}\\color{green}{a_k^{L-1}} + \\ldots \\\\\n\\frac{\\color{orange}{\\partial z_j^L}}{\\color{blue}{\\partial w_{{j},{k}}^L}}& =  \\color{green}{a_k^{L-1}}\n\\end{align}\n\nNote: Pay particular attention to the k index in the equation above! Remember, our weights are applied to the activations of the previous layer, which we are using k to index!\nJust as we did above, we can define a neuron specific error measure for neuron j in layer L as:\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\delta_{j}^L &= \\frac{\\dc}{\\color{orange}{\\partial}\\color{orange}{z_j^L}} \\\\\n             &= \\frac{\\color{green}{\\partial \\color{green}{a_j^L}}}{\\color{orange}{\\partial z_j^L}}\\frac{\\dc}{\\color{green}{\\partial \\color{green}{a_j^L}}}\\\\\n             &= \\sigma(\\color{orange}{z_j^L})\\sigma(1-\\color{orange}{z_j^L}) (\\color{green}{a_j^L}- y_j)\n\\end{align}\n\nNote: pay particular attention to the j index above! This is with respect to the current layer, which we are using j to index!\nThis lets us rewrite the above as:\n\n\\frac{\\dc}{\\color{blue}{\\partial w_{{j},{k}}^L}}= \\color{green}{a_k^{L-1}} \\delta_{j}^L\n\nAbove we’ve given the equation for how the cost changes with a specific weight in our multi dimensional network. Notice how close it is to the 1D case!\n\n💪🏽Exercise: Give the equation for \\frac{\\dc}{\\color{purple}{\\partial b^L_j}}\n\nNow, lets look at \\frac{\\dc}{\\color{green}{\\partial \\color{green}{a_k^{L-1}}}}. This is asking how the cost varies when we change the activation of a neuron k in layer L-1.\nJust using pattern matching, we might want to write:\n\n\\frac{\\dc}{\\color{green}{\\partial \\color{green}{a_k^{L-1}}}} \\stackrel{\\color{red}{?}}{=} \\color{blue}{w_{{j},{k}}^L}\\delta_j^L\n\nBut this is incorrect! To see why, lets draw a picture showing how nueron k in layer L-1 affects the current layer (and therefore the cost):\n\nAha! The activation of neuron k in layer L-1: \\color{green}{a_k^{L-1}} does not just flow through neuron j in layer L, it flows through every single neuron in layer L!\nSo if we want to account for the effect a small nudge to this neuron’s activation value has on our cost, we need to account for each neuron in layer L, and each associated weight!\nOur correct equation is then:\n\n\\frac{\\dc}{\\color{green}{\\partial \\color{green}{a_k^{L-1}}}} = \\sum_j \\left[ \\color{blue}{w_{{j},{k}}^L}\\delta_j^L \\right]\n\n\n\nImplementation\nOk! We’ve gone to the multidimensional case, but still given equations for each individual parameter. So really, its almost exactly as it was in the 1D case!\n\n💪🏽Exercise: Implement the backprop equations above!\n\nAs a hint, some pseudo-code for the implementation would be:\n# skipping setup\n# skipping forward pass\n\nfor sample in inputs:\n    # last layer\n    for neuron_j in layer[-1].neurons:\n        delta_j = # calculate according to formula above\n        dc_dwj = # calculate according to formula above\n        dc_dbj = # calculate according to formula above\n        dc_dak^{L-1} = # calculate according to formula above\n    \n    # other layers\n    for layer in layers-1:\n        for neuron_j in layer[l].neurons:\n            delta_j = # calculate according to formula above\n            dc_dwj = # calculate according to formula above\n            dc_dbj = # calculate according to formula above\n            dc_dak^{L-1} = # calculate according to formula above"

    "text": "N-D Revisited - Vector Notation\nAbove, we gave specific equations for each parameter in a multi dimensional network. This will work, as your implementation should prove!\nHowever, it leaves much to be desired in terms of efficiency, and conciseness, and it doesn’t allow us to make full use of the magic of our numerical linear algebra libraries!\nLets begin our analysis with our error vector \\delta_{j}^L:\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\delta_{j}^L &= \\frac{\\dc}{\\color{orange}{\\partial}\\color{orange}{z_j^L}} \\\\\n             &= \\frac{\\color{green}{\\partial \\color{green}{a_j^L}}}{\\color{orange}{\\partial z_j^L}}\\frac{\\dc}{\\color{green}{\\partial \\color{green}{a_j^L}}}\\\\\n             &= \\sigma(\\color{orange}{z_j^L})\\sigma(1-\\color{orange}{z_j^L}) (\\color{green}{a_j^L}- y_j) \\\\\n             &= \\sigma^{\\color{red}{\\prime}}(\\color{orange}{z_j^L}) (\\color{green}{a_j^L}- y_j)\n\\end{align}\n where we brought back the \\sigma^{\\color{red}{\\prime}}(\\cdot) notation.\nWe would like to write a vector for our error \\delta^L, where each component is:\n\n\\delta^L = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\sigma^{\\color{red}{\\prime}}(\\color{orange}{z_1^L}) (\\color{green}{a_1^L} - y_1) \\\\\n\\cdots \\\\\n\\sigma^{\\color{red}{\\prime}}(\\color{orange}{z_j^L}) (\\color{green}{a_j^L} - y_j)\\\\\n\\cdots\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nThis is exactly the definition of element-wise product of the following vectors: \\color{orange}{\\mathbf{z}^L},\\color{green}{\\mathbf{a}^L} and \\mathbf{y}:\n\n\\delta^L = \\sigma^{\\color{red}{\\prime}}(\\color{orange}{\\mathbf{z}^L}) \\odot (\\color{green}{\\mathbf{a}^L} - \\mathbf{y})\n\nwhere we introduce another piece of notation:\n\n📖Definition: The Hadamard product between two vectors is the element-wise product:\n\n\\mathbf{a} \\odot \\mathbf{b} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\na_1 \\cdot b_1 \\\\\n\\cdots \\\\\na_n \\cdot b_n\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\n\nLets define a function to implement this element-wise product:\n\ndef hadamard(a,b):\n    result = np.zeros_like(a)\n    for i in range(a.shape[0]):\n        result[i] = a[i] * b[i]\n    \n    return result\n\nLets test it!\n\na,b = np.random.randint(1,10,(3,1)),np.random.randint(1,10,(3,1))\na,b\n\n(array([[9],\n        [9],\n        [8]]),\n array([[8],\n        [5],\n        [1]]))\n\n\n\nhadamard(a,b)\n\narray([[72],\n       [45],\n       [ 8]])\n\n\nIt works!\nHowever, Python actually already does this element-wise product for us! Using the * operator!\n\na*b\n\narray([[72],\n       [45],\n       [ 8]])\n\n\nSo we didn’t have to implement our own. But thats ok, because we know how to. Lets get back to business!\n\nWe’ve rewritten BP1 in vector notation. Lets now focus on BP2: moving the error “backward”.\nWell, we can probably already guess its going to involve the hadamard product with \\sigma^{\\color{red}{\\prime}}(\\cdot) as it did previously. We just don’t know with what yet!\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\delta^\\ell = ?? \\odot \\sigma^{\\color{red}{\\prime}}(\\mathbf{\\zx{\\ell}})\n\\end{align}\n\nWell, lets try to reason through it from “first principles” (recall: this means make the sizes work!).\n\\delta^\\ell is a vector, which should be of size k, the number of elements in layer \\ell. We know its going to be formed with the weight matrix and \\delta^{\\ell+1}, so lets write their sizes:\n\n\\color{blue}{W^{\\ell+1}}: (j \\times k), \\quad\\quad \\delta^{\\ell+1}: (j \\times 1)\n\nHow do we multiply these out to get a vector of size k \\times 1 out?\n🧐\nIndeed! We need to transpose our weight matrix, and then take the usual matrix-vector product with \\delta^{\\ell+1}!\nNow we can write the vectorized equation for the error at any layer:\n\n📖Vectorized BP2: The error at any layer \\ell can be written as as function of the next layer as:\n\n\\delta^{\\ell} = (\\color{blue}{W^{\\ell+1}})^T \\delta^{\\ell+1} \\odot \\sigma^{\\color{red}{\\prime}}(\\mathbf{\\zx{\\ell}})\n\n\n\n🧐Pause-and-ponder: What can we say about our previous interpretation in light of this new equation?\n\nLets quickly tackle BP3:\n\n📖Vectorized-BP3:\n\n\\frac{\\dc}{\\color{purple}{\\partial \\mathbf{b}^\\ell}} = \\delta^\\ell\n\n\nWell, that was easy! Its just as it was above, but as a vector.\nHm. Now we get to the tough one: BP4. This is now a partial derivative of our cost with respect to weight matrix!\nLets start at the last layer. \\color{blue}{W^L} is of size j \\times k, where j is the size of the last layer.\nSo, we should expect its gradient to be of the same size: a matrix. If its not clear why, just imagine how were going to use this partial. We’re going to add it the current value of \\color{blue}{W} in gradient descent, so it better be of the same size!\nTo form this matrix, we have \\color{green}{\\mathbf{a}^{L-1}}, which is of size k \\times 1, the size of the previous layer, and \\delta^L, which is of size j \\times 1.\nSo how do we form this matrix using these two vectors? We take the outer product:\n\n\\delta^L(\\color{green}{\\mathbf{a}^{L-1}})^T\n\nLets make sure the sizes work!\n\n(j \\times 1)(1 \\times k) = (j \\times k)\n\nPerfect!\n\n📖Vectorized BP4:\n\n\\frac{\\dc}{ \\color{blue}{ \\partial \\mathbf{W^\\ell} } } = \\delta^L(\\color{green}{\\mathbf{a}^{L-1}})^T\n\n\nFinally! Lets give fully vectorized forms of the batchprop equations:\n\n\nF.F.B.E - Vectorized™\nLets cap this off by writing vectorized versions of the four fundamental backpropagation equations:\n\n📖Definition: Vectorized versions of the Four Fundamental Backpropagation Equations™ are given by:\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\delta^L &= (\\color{green}{\\mathbf{a}^L} - \\mathbf{y})  \\odot  \\sigma^{\\color{red}{\\prime}}(\\color{orange}{\\mathbf{z}^L}) \\tag{BP1}\\\\\n\\delta^{\\ell} &= (\\color{blue}{W^{\\ell+1}})^T \\delta^{\\ell+1} \\odot \\sigma^{\\color{red}{\\prime}}(\\mathbf{\\zx{\\ell}})\\tag{BP2} \\\\\n\\frac{\\dc}{\\color{purple}{\\partial \\mathbf{b}^\\ell}} &= \\delta^\\ell \\tag{BP3} \\\\\n\\frac{\\dc}{ \\color{blue}{ \\partial \\mathbf{W^\\ell} } } &= \\delta^\\ell(\\color{green}{\\mathbf{a}^{\\ell-1}})^T \\tag{BP4}\n\\end{align}\n\n\n\n\n\nImplementation\nWow! Now we’ve really come a long way!\n\n💪🏽Exercise: Implement the backprop equations above!\n\nAs you’re implementing this, think about the following:\n\n🧐Pause-and-ponder: How do you deal with multiple samples?\n\nInitialize our toy problem as always:\n\nX,y = toy()\n\nSince we’re still dealing with a flat implementation, lets go ahead and initialize our weights and biases here:\n\n# initialize weight matrices - notice the dimensions\nW_1_init = np.random.randn(3,1)\nW_2_init = np.random.randn(2,3)\nW_3_init = np.random.randn(1,2)\nweights = [W_1_init,W_2_init,W_3_init]\n\n# and our biases\nb_1_init = np.random.randn(3,1)\nb_2_init = np.random.randn(2,1)\nb_3_init = np.random.randn(1,1)\nbiases = [b_1_init,b_2_init,b_3_init]\n\nNow we can use the feedforward batch implementation we gave above:\n\ndef feedforward_batch(X, weights, biases):\n    # assume inputs is of shape Nxd\n    W_1,W_2,W_3 = weights[0],weights[1],weights[2]\n    b_1,b_2,b_3 = biases[0],biases[1],biases[2]\n    \n    activities = []\n    activations = []\n    \n    # NOTE - there is no for loop here! \n    \n    # treat activations like layer_0 activations:\n    activations.append(X.T)\n    \n    # layer 1\n    z_1 = W_1.dot(X.T) + b_1\n    a_1 = sigmoid(z_1)\n    activities.append(z_1)\n    activations.append(np.squeeze(np.asarray(a_1)))\n    \n    # layer 2\n    z_2 = W_2.dot(a_1)+b_2\n    a_2 = sigmoid(z_2)\n    activities.append(z_2)\n    activations.append(np.squeeze(np.asarray(a_2)))\n    \n    # output layer\n    z_3 = W_3.dot(a_2)+b_3\n    y_hat = sigmoid(z_3)\n    activities.append(z_3)\n    activations.append(np.asarray(y_hat))\n    \n    return activities, activations\n\nLets actually feed-forward our entire dataset:\n\nactivities, activations = feedforward_batch(X,weights,biases)\n\nLets check the sizes of these:\n\nprint(activities[0].shape,activities[1].shape,activities[2].shape)\n\n(3, 1000) (2, 1000) (1, 1000)\n\n\n\nprint(activations[0].shape,activations[1].shape,\n      activations[2].shape, activations[3].shape)\n\n(1, 1000) (3, 1000) (2, 1000) (1, 1000)\n\n\nNote: We’re calling our input our first activity, which is why there is one extra.\nNow we’re ready to run backprop on each sample in our dataset, to generate bias and weight updates for each sample.\nLets start with a sigmoid prime function we will need:\n\ndef sigmoid_prime(z):\n    return sigmoid(z)*(1-sigmoid(z))\n\n\nplt.plot(sigmoid(np.linspace(-10,10)));\nplt.plot(sigmoid_prime(np.linspace(-10,10)));\n\n\n\n\nLets continue our work:\n\nN,d = inputs.shape\n\nweight_updates = []\nbias_updates = []\n\n\nlayer_num = len(activations)\nweight_updates = []\nbias_updates = []\n\nNow our equations are above are only for one sample! So lets pick one and proceed:\n\nsample_idx = 0\n\nOk, so lets run backprop on that one sample, by starting with our last layer:\n\n########################################\n#           Last Level\n########################################\n# get last layer specific variables\nz_L = activities[-1][:,sample_idx].reshape(-1,1)\na_L = activations[-1][:,sample_idx].reshape(-1,1)\na_L_minus_1 = activations[-2][:,sample_idx].reshape(-1,1)\n\n\n(z_L.shape,a_L.shape,a_L_minus_1.shape)\n\n((1, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1))\n\n\nAre these what we expect?\nLets use them in the formulas we gave above!\n\n# calculate delta_L for the last level\ndelta_L = (a_L-y[sample_idx])*sigmoid_prime(z_L)\n\n\ndelta_L.shape\n\n(1, 1)\n\n\nLets make a list to store all these delta values!\n\ndeltas = []\ndeltas.append(delta_L)\n\nNow lets calculate the bias update:\n\n# calculate bias update\ndc_db_l = delta_L\nbias_updates = [dc_db_l] + bias_updates\ndc_db_l.shape\n\n(1, 1)\n\n\nAnd the weight update:\n\n# calcualte weight updates\ndc_dw_l = delta_L.dot((a_L_minus_1).T)\nweight_updates = [dc_dw_l] + weight_updates\ndc_dw_l.shape\n\n(1, 2)\n\n\nWow!

    "text": "Gradient Checking\nBackprop implementations are notoriously difficult to get right! That means we should implement some kind of numerical check for correctness.\n\n🧐Pause-and-ponder: Can you think of a way we could numerically check that our analytical gradients are correct?\n\n\nNumerical Gradients!\nHaving thought about it a bit, you might have thought to check our numerical approximations for the derivative!\nRecall, we could write the cost function as a function of one long vector of all of our parameters:\n\n\\czero(\\color{blue}{\\mathbf{W}_1,\\mathbf{W}_2,\\mathbf{W}_3},\\color{purple}{\\mathbf{b}_1,\\mathbf{b}_2,\\mathbf{b}_3}) = \\czero(\\color{blue}{w_{0,0},w_{0,1},\\ldots,w_{1,0},w_{1,1}},\\ldots,\\color{purple}{b_{0,0},b_{0,1}},\\ldots)\n\nTo abstract this away, we can write it out as:\n\n\\czero (\\theta_1,\\theta_2,\\ldots,\\theta_i,\\ldots)\n\nWell, then one way we could check for correctness, is to calculate the two sided difference \\Delta_i:\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\Delta_i &= \\frac{\\czero (\\theta_1,\\theta_2,\\ldots,\\color{red}{\\theta_i+\\epsilon},\\ldots) - \\czero (\\theta_1,\\theta_2,\\ldots,\\color{red}{\\theta_i-\\epsilon},\\ldots)}{2\\epsilon}\n\\end{align}\n\nWe know this is an approximation for our desired partial when \\epsilon is very small:\n\n\\Delta_i \\approx \\frac{\\dc}{\\partial \\theta_i}\n\nSo we can use this approximation to see how close it is to our analytical gradient!\nSpecifically, we want to calculate:\n\n\\frac{\\|\\Delta_i - \\frac{\\dc}{\\partial \\theta_i}  \\|_2}{\\|\\Delta_i\\|_2 + \\|\\frac{\\dc}{\\partial \\theta_i}\\|_2  }\n\nAnd verify that this is very small for all of our parameters! Specifically, we can choose \\epsilon = 10^{-7}, and expect this difference to be <10^{-7}. If so, we can call our backprop code:\n\nnumerically verified™ 😎\n\nA note before we proceed, its very common to use the ravel function to do this flattening out, and then use concatenate to join our newly flattened arrays”\n\na,b = np.random.randint(1,10,(3,2)),np.random.randint(1,10,(4,3))\na,b\n\n(array([[2, 5],\n        [6, 1],\n        [3, 8]]),\n array([[3, 5, 8],\n        [8, 1, 1],\n        [3, 9, 6],\n        [7, 5, 4]]))\n\n\n\na.ravel()\n\narray([2, 5, 6, 1, 3, 8])\n\n\n\nnp.concatenate((a.ravel(),b.ravel()))\n\narray([2, 5, 6, 1, 3, 8, 3, 5, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 9, 6, 7, 5, 4])\n\n\nSo now, we can use these to flatten all of our parameters, and join them into one big vector which we can then perturb.\nLets define a couple helper functions which will help us unravel and then reform them.\nThe first is get_params, which will return a single vector of all our parameters, using python’s list comprehension:\n\ndef get_params(weights,biases):\n    weight_params = [weight.ravel() for weight in weights]\n    bias_params = [bias.ravel() for bias in biases]\n    all_params = weight_params+bias_params\n    return np.concatenate(all_params)\n\n\nget_params(weights,biases)\n\narray([ 0.14188865,  0.63484706,  0.12494954,  0.12396009,  0.84370276,\n        0.35345227,  0.92243417,  0.46469144,  0.24677724,  0.86751385,\n        0.10747816,  0.66656228,  0.15417883,  0.02532289,  0.60376072,\n        0.04574494, -1.0101568 , -0.64885254,  0.78366491,  0.34014546,\n        0.54846053,  0.11253149,  0.44440565,  0.58982193,  0.43253046])\n\n\nVerify that this is of the correct length, based on our network structure!\n\nget_params(weights,biases).shape\n\n(25,)\n\n\nWe can also define a set_params function, which is responsible for re-forming our parameters into the correct shapes, given one long vector:\n\ndef set_params(param_vector,orig_weights,orig_biases):\n    # set weights\n    new_weights=[]\n    pointer = 0\n    for weight_mat in orig_weights:\n        curr_len = (weight_mat.shape[0]*weight_mat.shape[1])\n        new_mat = param_vector[pointer:pointer+curr_len].reshape(weight_mat.shape)\n        new_weights.append(new_mat)\n        pointer += curr_len\n    \n    # set biases\n    new_biases=[]\n    for weight_vec in orig_biases:\n        curr_len = (weight_vec.shape[0]*weight_vec.shape[1])\n        new_vec = param_vector[pointer:pointer+curr_len].reshape(weight_vec.shape)\n        new_biases.append(new_vec)\n        pointer += curr_len\n        \n    return new_weights,new_biases\n\nNote: This function takes an original set of weights and biases, but only uses it for the sizes of each element!\nLets run both of our new functions and verify they work as expected:\n\nnew_weights,new_biases = set_params(get_params(weights,biases),weights,biases)\n\nNow we can once again use list comprehension to quickly check if new_weights is equal to weights, and new_biases is equal to biases at each element:\n\n[np.array_equal(i,j) for i,j in zip(weights,new_weights)]\n\n[True, True, True]\n\n\n\n[np.array_equal(i,j) for i,j in zip(biases,new_biases)]\n\n[True, True, True]\n\n\nWe should see all True there! Perfect, our unraveling and raveling works as we expect. Now we can use this to perform gradient checking.\n\n\nImplementation\nWe can now begin to implement our numerical gradient checking, by defining a function that lets us do this:\n\ndef gradient_checking(weights,biases,batch,idx,current_label,weight_updates,bias_updates,epsilon=1e-7):\n\n    # unravel the current params\n    params = get_params(weights,biases)\n    diff_vec = np.zeros_like(params)\n\n    # loop through, perturbing one parameter at a time:\n    for p_index in range(params.shape[0]):\n        perturb = np.zeros_like(params)\n        perturb[p_index] = epsilon\n\n        # feedforward at each side\n        _, activations_p = feedforward_batch(batch,*set_params(params + perturb,weights,biases))\n        _, activations_m = feedforward_batch(batch,*set_params(params - perturb,weights,biases))\n\n        # calculate cost of each side\n        cost_plus = cost_mse(activations_p[-1][:,idx],current_label)\n        cost_minus = cost_mse(activations_m[-1][:,idx],current_label)\n\n        # calcualte \\Delta_i\n        diff_vec[p_index] = (cost_plus - cost_minus)/(2*epsilon)\n\n    # calculate the difference for this round of backprop\n    grad_vec = get_params(weight_updates, bias_updates)\n    grad_error = np.linalg.norm(diff_vec - grad_vec)/(np.linalg.norm(diff_vec) + np.linalg.norm(grad_vec))\n   \n    if grad_error > epsilon:\n        print(\"Error in gradient calculation!\")\n   \n    return grad_error\n\nThis function takes the following:\n\nweights: the current weights of our network\nbiases: the current biases of our network\nbatch: the current batch of data\nidx: the index of our current sample,\ncurrent_label: the current label, of the current sample\nweight_updates: the list of gradients of the weights we calculated\nbias_updates: the list of gradients of the biases we calculated\nepsilon=1e-7: a default epsilon value\n\nIts a bit verbose, but thats because we’re going for a flat implementation. Once we’ve understood all the pieces, we can wrap everything up nice and neat.\nWith this, lets re-run our training but this time perform gradient checking!\n\ndef backprop_1_example1(activities,activations,y,quiet=True):\n    my_bp['act'].append(activations)\n    \n    layer_num = len(activations)\n    weight_updates = []\n    bias_updates = []\n    \n    ########################################\n    #           Last Level\n    ########################################\n    # get last layer specific variables\n    a_L = activations[-1].reshape(-1,1)\n    a_L_minus_1 = activations[-2].reshape(-1,1)\n    z_L = activities[-1].reshape(-1,1)\n    \n    # calculate delta_L for the last level\n    delta_L = (a_L-y)*sigmoid_prime(z_L)\n    my_bp['delta'].append(delta_L)\n    \n    deltas = []\n    deltas.append(delta_L)\n\n    # calculate bias update\n    dc_db_L = delta_L\n    bias_updates = [dc_db_L] + bias_updates\n\n    # calcualte weight updates\n    dc_dw_L = delta_L.dot((a_L_minus_1).T)\n    my_bp['w'].append(dc_dw_L)\n    weight_updates = [dc_dw_L] + weight_updates\n    \n    if not quiet:\n        print(f'=========Layer:{layer_num+-1}=========')\n        print(f'Using negative index: -1')\n        print(f'z_l:{z_L.shape}, a_l:{a_L.shape}, a_l_minus_1:{a_L_minus_1.shape}')\n        print(f'delta_l:{delta_L.shape}, dc_db_l:{dc_db_L.shape},dc_dw_l:{dc_dw_L.shape}')\n        print()\n    \n    ########################################\n    # loop through each layer, from 2 to L-1\n    ######################################## \n    for layer in range(2,layer_num):\n        # using level as a **negative index**\n        l = -layer\n        \n        # uncomment this print statement \n        # to help you understand how negative indexing works\n        # print(f\"Loop variable: {layer}, l={l}, corresponding to layer: l{l}\")\n\n        # calculate delta_l for each layer\n        a_l = activations[l].reshape(-1,1)\n        z_l = activities[l].reshape(-1,1)\n        delta_l = weights[l+1].T.dot(deltas[l+1]) * sigmoid_prime(z_l)\n        my_bp['delta'].append(delta_l)\n        deltas = [delta_l] + deltas\n\n        # calculate bias update\n        dc_db_l = delta_l\n        bias_updates = [dc_db_l] + bias_updates\n\n        # calcualte weight updates\n        a_l_minus_1 = activations[l-1].reshape(-1,1)\n        dc_dw_l = delta_l.dot((a_l_minus_1).T)\n        my_bp['w'].append(dc_dw_l)\n        weight_updates = [dc_dw_l] + weight_updates\n        \n        if not quiet:\n            print(f'=========Layer:{layer_num+l}=========')\n            print(f'Using negative index: {l}')\n            print(f'z_l:{z_l.shape}, a_l:{a_l.shape}, a_l_minus_1:{a_l_minus_1.shape}')\n            print(f'delta_l:{delta_l.shape}, dc_db_l:{dc_db_l.shape},dc_dw_l:{dc_dw_l.shape}')\n            print()\n    \n    return weight_updates, bias_updates\n\n\n# dataset\nN = X.shape[0]\nd = X.shape[1]\nbatch_size = 50\nepochs = 10\neta=1e-2\ndataset=X\nlabels=y\nquiet=False\n\n# gradient checking\nepsilon = 1e-7\n\n# initialize weight matrices -

    "text": "Fully vectorized implementation\nOk! We’ve done a lot of hard work! Now we’ve come to the final linear algebraic thing we need to do to make this fast 🏎💨.\nWe want to be able to backprop across batches, instead of across individual samples in a batch.\nTo do so, we will have to introduce 3D matrices!. In math these are called tensors!\n\n📖 Definition: For our purposes, a tensor is defined as a multidimensional matrix.\nNote: In python, these objects are called “N-D arrays” or just “arrays”. Vectors, and matrices are just 1D and 2D versions of these tensors/arrays.\n\nLets create one right now!\n\na = np.random.randint(1,10,(3,3,3))\na\n\narray([[[9, 7, 3],\n        [5, 4, 2],\n        [7, 7, 8]],\n\n       [[2, 7, 1],\n        [7, 3, 3],\n        [7, 9, 3]],\n\n       [[4, 6, 9],\n        [5, 4, 2],\n        [2, 8, 5]]])\n\n\n🤔\nThis doesn’t look that special. Thats just because were printing this 3D object on a 2D notebook. Pay special attention to the [ and ] characters and you’ll notice its almost like its a list of a 2D matrices. Indeed, for right now, we can just think of it like that.\nLets grab the first matrix in the list:\n\na[0,:,:]\n\narray([[9, 7, 3],\n       [5, 4, 2],\n       [7, 7, 8]])\n\n\nAnd the second:\n\na[1,:,:]\n\narray([[2, 7, 1],\n       [7, 3, 3],\n       [7, 9, 3]])\n\n\nAnd the last:\n\na[-1,:,:]\n\narray([[4, 6, 9],\n       [5, 4, 2],\n       [2, 8, 5]])\n\n\nOk, so far so good. Lets understand one more thing we need to do with these objects.\nWe want to be able to take this list/stack of matrices, and multiply the stack with another vector matrix. In other words, if I have a tensor T, which contains four matrices which we will call A, B, C, and D I want to be able to do something like:\nT*v = R\nwhere R is now a stack which contains Av,Bv, Cv, Dv.\nAnd then at the end, I can average across the stack dimension, to produce one final 2D matrix which is just:\n(Av+Bv+Cv+Dv)/4\nOk. We’ve described in words the procedure we want to perform, so lets go about coding it up! To make this clear, lets define our tensor T as we described above:\n\nA = np.ones((3,3))\nA\n\narray([[1., 1., 1.],\n       [1., 1., 1.],\n       [1., 1., 1.]])\n\n\n\nB = np.ones((3,3))*2\nB\n\narray([[2., 2., 2.],\n       [2., 2., 2.],\n       [2., 2., 2.]])\n\n\n\nC = np.ones((3,3))*3\nC\n\narray([[3., 3., 3.],\n       [3., 3., 3.],\n       [3., 3., 3.]])\n\n\n\nD = np.ones((3,3))*4\nD\n\narray([[4., 4., 4.],\n       [4., 4., 4.],\n       [4., 4., 4.]])\n\n\n\nT = np.zeros((4,3,3))\nT[0,:,:] = A\nT[1,:,:] = B\nT[2,:,:] = C\nT[3,:,:] = D\nT.shape,T\n\n((4, 3, 3),\n array([[[1., 1., 1.],\n         [1., 1., 1.],\n         [1., 1., 1.]],\n \n        [[2., 2., 2.],\n         [2., 2., 2.],\n         [2., 2., 2.]],\n \n        [[3., 3., 3.],\n         [3., 3., 3.],\n         [3., 3., 3.]],\n \n        [[4., 4., 4.],\n         [4., 4., 4.],\n         [4., 4., 4.]]]))\n\n\nNote: we could have also used np.stack to do this for us:\n\nnp.stack((A,B,C,D)).shape\n\n(4, 3, 3)\n\n\nAnd now lets create that vector we wanted:\n\nv = np.ones((3,1))\nv\n\narray([[1.],\n       [1.],\n       [1.]])\n\n\nand verify how it interacts with each matrix in our stack:\n\nA.dot(v)\n\narray([[3.],\n       [3.],\n       [3.]])\n\n\n\nB.dot(v)\n\narray([[6.],\n       [6.],\n       [6.]])\n\n\n\nC.dot(v)\n\narray([[9.],\n       [9.],\n       [9.]])\n\n\n\nD.dot(v)\n\narray([[12.],\n       [12.],\n       [12.]])\n\n\nOk! So now we know what we want R to look like. It should be the stack of those vectors.\nWe can create this using the matmul function, which stands for matrix multiply. We can check its documentation:\n\n# np.matmul?\n\nThe line that we are interested in is the following:\nIf either argument is N-D, N > 2, it is treated as a stack of matrices residing in the last two indexes and broadcast accordingly.\nThats exactly what we want! So lets use it!\n\nR = np.matmul(T,v)\nR\n\narray([[[ 3.],\n        [ 3.],\n        [ 3.]],\n\n       [[ 6.],\n        [ 6.],\n        [ 6.]],\n\n       [[ 9.],\n        [ 9.],\n        [ 9.]],\n\n       [[12.],\n        [12.],\n        [12.]]])\n\n\nPerfect! Thats what we expected! Lets stop and realize this:\nYou can think of this one function as having handled the three separate multiplications for us! In one function! And it did so as fast as possible because its relying on the underlying numerical libraries!\nHint: In a few cells from now, we will see this is exactly what we want to do for our batch!\nThe matmul function is also represented by the handy @ symbol, meaning we could also just type:\n\nR = T@v\nR\n\narray([[[ 3.],\n        [ 3.],\n        [ 3.]],\n\n       [[ 6.],\n        [ 6.],\n        [ 6.]],\n\n       [[ 9.],\n        [ 9.],\n        [ 9.]],\n\n       [[12.],\n        [12.],\n        [12.]]])\n\n\nNote: matmul/@ work as we expect in simpler cases:\n\na,b = np.random.randint(1,10,(3,2)),np.random.randint(1,10,(2,3))\na,b\n\n(array([[3, 2],\n        [7, 1],\n        [2, 3]]),\n array([[6, 8, 5],\n        [4, 4, 1]]))\n\n\n\na@b, a.dot(b)\n\n(array([[26, 32, 17],\n        [46, 60, 36],\n        [24, 28, 13]]),\n array([[26, 32, 17],\n        [46, 60, 36],\n        [24, 28, 13]]))\n\n\nOne final thing which might be useful, is the einsum function:\n\n# np.einsum?\n\nThis is a very powerful function, but we can use it in a straightforward manner to just describe to numpy the shapes of each of our matrices, and the shape we want afterwards!\nLets revisit the T/R example above\n\nnp.einsum('ijk,kl->ikl',T,v)\n\narray([[[ 3.],\n        [ 3.],\n        [ 3.]],\n\n       [[ 6.],\n        [ 6.],\n        [ 6.]],\n\n       [[ 9.],\n        [ 9.],\n        [ 9.]],\n\n       [[12.],\n        [12.],\n        [12.]]])\n\n\n🤯\nWhat?! What just happened! Well, we just described the operation we wanted directly in terms of sizes using the Einstein summation convention.\nWe said T is of size i x j x k, and that v is of size k x l, and I want to turn this into something that is of size i x k x l. And thats exactly what we got!\nThe last thing we want to do is “collapse” across one of our dimensions to form the average. This is easy in numpy, we just tell numpy across what axis we want to average:\n\nR = T@v\nR\n\narray([[[ 3.],\n        [ 3.],\n        [ 3.]],\n\n       [[ 6.],\n        [ 6.],\n        [ 6.]],\n\n       [[ 9.],\n        [ 9.],\n        [ 9.]],\n\n       [[12.],\n        [12.],\n        [12.]]])\n\n\n\nR.shape\n\n(4, 3, 1)\n\n\n\nnp.mean(R,axis=0)\n\narray([[7.5],\n       [7.5],\n       [7.5]])\n\n\n\nnp.mean(R,axis=0).shape\n\n(3, 1)\n\n\nIt worked! We told numpy to take the average across the first dimension (axis=0), so the result is the 3x1 matrix/vector which is just the average of all of the members of our stack!\n\nLets point out one more potentially confusing aspect of our implementations. Lets take an activation matrix as our example. The tranpose of this matrix is of size batch_size x nodes in our layer.\nWe’ve been using this 2D matrix to represent our collection of vectors, implicitly.\nWe could make this more explicit, by adding on the missing dimension, making it: batch_size x nodes in our layer x 1 - giving us a clearer interpretation of this as a stack of vectors.\n\na = np.random.randint(1,10,(10,3))\na\n\narray([[9, 4, 3],\n       [6, 1, 5],\n       [4, 3, 6],\n       [2, 5, 9],\n       [1, 6, 2],\n       [7, 7, 6],\n       [4, 5, 4],\n       [3, 6, 9],\n       [6, 3, 2],\n       [3, 1, 6]])\n\n\n\na = a[:,:,np.newaxis]\n\nNow, a is a stack of column vectors! Lets grab the first vector:\n\na[0,:,:]\n\narray([[9],\n       [4],\n       [3]])\n\n\n\nImplementation\nThis is the final piece of the puzzle we need. We are now ready to use this in our backprop implementation! Lets look at our old implementation:\n\nactivities, activations = feedforward_batch(X,weights,biases)\n\n\nweight_updates = []\nbias_updates = []\nlayer_num = len(activations)\n\n\nfor activity in activities:\n    print(activity.shape) \n\n(3, 1000)\n(3, 1000)\n(1, 1000)\n\n\n\nfor activation in activations:\n    print(activation.shape) \n\n(2, 1000)\n(3, 1000)\n(3, 1000)\n(1, 1000)\n\n\nThis is like having a batch_size of 1000. Lets continue! We want to move the batch size to the front so that its out of the way!\n\nfor activation in activations:\n    print(activation.T.shape) \n\n(1000, 2)\n(1000, 3)\n(1000, 3)\n(1000, 1)\n\n\nIts to these that we want to add our “new dimension” to clearly make these a stack:\n\nfor activation in activations:\n    print((activation.T)[:,:,np.newaxis].shape) \n\n(1000, 2, 1)\n(1000, 3, 1)\n(1000, 3, 1)\n(1000, 1, 1)\n\n\nThis is saying: I have a batch_size-many stack, composed of vectors, where each vector is ___ size.\nPerfect!
